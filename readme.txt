RELEASE NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for downloading this program.

I made this program in a couple of days just to kill some time.
I have tested it reasonably thoroughly, but there may still be bugs,
if you find any, I'd love to know about it.

If I get enough positive feedback (or too much spare time), I may
work on a Win32 Development package for Duke Nukem 3D (but don't
hold your breath). If you know of any features which would be good,
once again, just drop me an email.

Some of the features of this program:

  * Win32 interface for Duke Nukem 3D Grp Files
  * On the fly manipulation of files
  * Drag and drop features
  * It's fast
  * That's about it.

I hope someone finds this usefull. If you're interested, I will be
putting the source code on the same site as this download, once I get
it up.
